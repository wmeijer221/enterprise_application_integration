# Movie Sentiment Dashboard

This repository implements a generic infrastructure, using message-oriented-middleware (MOM), to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, built as part of the course [Enterprise Application Integration](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WMCS007-05).
This system extracts data (user reviews) from various sources (e.g. reddit, twitter, IMDB, ...), translating it into a canonical data model, after which its sentiment is extracted.
In this dashboard, people will be able to view public opinion in form of sentiment (quantitative) on movies (among others).
